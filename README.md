Load Impact integrates nicely with TeamCity, continuous integration and delivery server from JetBrains. Using our robust and extensible APIs you can integrate Load Impact’s world-leading performance testing platform into your automated TeamCity build and test process.

Load Impact covers your back with everything you need for Web, API and application performance testing. And test scripting is simple.

We have two flavours - one executing the test in PowerShell for windows users and one executing the test in Bash for \*nix users.
