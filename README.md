Integrate LoadImpact V3 with TeamCity
=======================================================

This project is deprecated because it integrates TeamCity with the LoadImpact V3 cloud service that will sunset at the end of 2020.

If you want to use TeamCity to run performance or load tests, check out the tutorial: [How to automate Load Testing with k6 in TeamCity builds](https://k6.io/blog/load-testing-using-teamcity-and-k6)

-------

Load Impact integrates nicely with TeamCity, continuous integration and delivery server from JetBrains. Using our robust and extensible APIs you can integrate Load Impactâ€™s world-leading performance testing platform into your automated TeamCity build and test process.

Load Impact covers your back with everything you need for Web, API and application performance testing. And test scripting is simple.

To get started, try one of these samples of how to include performance testing in your TeamCity build setup.

We have two flavours - one executing the test in PowerShell for windows users and one executing the test in Bash for \*nix users.
